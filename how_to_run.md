Run workbooks assignment_3.ibynb, Component_Analysis_CPA.ibynb, and Component_Analysis_spotify.ibynb. 
You will have to make sure there is a folder called Input_data in the same directory as the python workbooks. The input_data should include the datasets that I am uploading to my github PR branch.


The majority of the figures should be automatically outputted into the images folder.
